üîß Job Automation Tool - Chrome Extension
This project is a browser extension designed to automate job search activities. The popup interface allows users to configure and control automation settings for job applications. It includes:

‚úÖ Job Title & Location Inputs: Users can specify the job role and location they're targeting.

‚úâÔ∏è Message Template: A customizable field where users can write a default message to be used in job applications or outreach.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start/Stop Automation: Buttons to begin or halt the automation process, potentially controlling a background script that performs actions like job searching or messaging.

The extension likely works in combination with JavaScript (popup.js) to handle button actions and communicate with background scripts that manage the actual automation tasks
